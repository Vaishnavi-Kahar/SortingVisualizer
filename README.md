# Sorting Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer project is a web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the sorting process step by step. Users can select a sorting algorithm and set the array size and speed of visualization using sliders. Upon choosing the sorting algorithm, user can visualize the sorting process.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The project currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

# Features
- Visual Representation: The sorting process is visualized on the screen, making it easier for users to understand the working of each sorting algorithm.
- Interactive Interface: Users can select different algorithms and adjusting array size and visualization speed.
- Random Array Generation: The application generates a random array each time the user visualizes a sorting algorithm.

# Usage
To use the Sorting Visualizer:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sorting-visualizer`
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
